# python-midi-sampler

### Overview
This project was started in collaboration with Professor Martinez at Colby College as part of an independent study. This was an interdisciplinary undertaking by nature, with Professor Martinez being a professor of music while I am a computer science student. This project was started as a possible tool Professor Martinez could use in his music theory classes in subsequent years. The idea was that by importing this software into a raspberry pi and connecting a midi keyboard, each student in the class would be able to have a portable piano for demonstrations, practice, and learning. This is currently a work in progress
